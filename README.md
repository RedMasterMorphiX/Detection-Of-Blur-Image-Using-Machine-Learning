This project introduces a novel approach to blur 
image detection, leveraging machine learning techniques. It 
combines traditional image quality features and deep learning 
through a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish 
between blurry and sharp images. The diverse training dataset 
ensures robustness and generalization, while data augmentation 
helps prevent overfitting. Experimental results on benchmark 
datasets validate the method's effectiveness in detecting blur across 
various contexts and severities, including motion and defocus blur. 
This approach represents a significant contribution to blur image 
detection, offering a versatile tool with the potential for further 
improvements as machine learning evolves, benefiting a wide 
range of real-world applications in image analysis and decision making
